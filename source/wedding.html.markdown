# The Wedding Itself

## Ceremony and reception

Our wedding will be at [Revolution Brewing][revbrew] in Chicago, Illinois on
Saturday, May 18, 2013 in the afternoon and evening. The ceremony will begin
promptly at 4:30pm with drinks, dinner, and dancing to follow at the same
location.

There is limited metered street parking in the neighborhood around Revolution,
but who wants to worry about feeding the meter? (Or driving home from a
brewery?) Revolution is an easy walk (500 feet) from the California stop on the
CTA Blue Line â€” easily accessible from either downtown Chicago or O'Hare
airport. For the public transit-skeptical, cabs are widely available in Chicago.
See the [Travel](locations.html) page for more info.

Requested attire is semi-formal.
