# Welcome

We’re excited to share this next step in our relationship with our
friends and family.

It all started with an exchanges of messages about Coen brother movies and
tastes in cuisine. A couple of nervous phone calls later and we wound up on
our first date at Mrs. Murphy and Sons Irish Bistro. Kelly thought Rhett was
quite cute and Rhett ordered dessert because he wanted a little longer to
talk. After insisting she wasn’t hungry, Kelly ate half of Rhett’s Oreo
cheesecake (a trend that continues) and we both went home with a feeling that
this just might turn into something.

After a year of dating adventures, family introductions, and contemplating cat
mergers we decided to move in together. Ada, Kepler, and Murray are now best
buddies and our small family is off to a great start!
