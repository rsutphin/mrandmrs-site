%h1 Welcome

  We’re excited to share this next step in our relationship with our
  friends and family.

  It all started with an exchanges of messages about Coen brother movies and
  tastes in cuisine. A couple of nervous phone calls later and we wound up on
  our first date at Mrs. Murphy and Sons Irish Bistro. Kelly thought Rhett was
  quite cute and Rhett ordered dessert because he wanted a little longer to
  talk. After insisting she wasn’t hungry, Kelly ate half of Rhett’s Oreo
  cheesecake (a trend that continues) and we both went home with a feeling that
  this just might turn into something.

  After a year of dating adventures, family introductions, and contemplating cat
  mergers we decided to move in together. Ada, Kepler, and Murray are now best
  buddies and our small family is off to a great start!
