# Visiting Chicago

There are lots of amazing things to do and see in Chicago.  These are some of
our favorites.

## Museum Campus

At the south end of Chicago's lakefront Grant Park, [museum campus][] is a
three-in- one stop for the avid museum goer.  Explore natural history at the
Field Museum, dive under the sea at Shedd Aquarium, or fly to the stars at the
Adler Planetarium.

If you're lucky, you might see Kelly getting a veggie dog on her lunch break
from the [Zooniverse][] offices at the Adler. If you do see her, don't think
that her condiment choices mean that it's okay to have ketchup on your
Chicago-style hot dog.

K&R tip: even if you don't want to learn about the universe, the peninsula that
houses the planetarium has the best views of the Chicago skyline you can get
without getting in a boat.

## Chicago History Museum

The [Chicago History Museum][chs] is a smaller institution that tells the
story of the second windy city of the broad shoulders. It also features
revolving special exhibits.

## Lincoln Park Zoo

As an outdoor zoological garden, the [Lincoln Park Zoo][lpzoo] is a great place to
spend a warm spring day. Best of all, admission is free — see as much or as
little as you like and come and go as you please.

If you plan on going to the Zoo, note that the <a href="travel.html#hotels-
daysinn" class="comingsoon">Days Inn Chicago</a> hotel is a short ride away in a
cab or the #22 bus.

## Music Box Theatre

The site of many dates throughout our relationship, the [Music Box][musicbox] is
a beautifully restored movie theater [from 1929][mb-history]. It offers a variety
of independent and foreign first-run releases, plus weekend matinee and midnight
movie series of classic films.

The Music Box publishes its [showing calendar][mb-comingsoon] seasonally, so
the schedule for our wedding week should be available by February or so.

## Hancock Building

The [fourth-tallest building in Chicago][chicago-tall], the John Hancock
Building has a couple of advantages as a tourist attraction for height
enthusiasts vs. its taller counterparts such as the Sears Tower.

* It's set off from the loop (the main portion of downtown), so you can see the city without looking straight down on it.
* It's right on the Magnificent Mile portion of Michigan Ave.
* It has a restaurant and bar on its top two floors.

That's right: instead of overpaying for an [observation platform ticket
][hancock-obs], you can take the elevator straight up to the [Signature Lounge
][sig-room] and overpay for a drink. It's a more relaxed and sophisticated
context in which to comment that all those people down on the ground look like
ants.

## Architectural Boat Tour

Did you know that Chicago is the home of the first skyscraper? And that it's the
city where Frank Lloyd Wright got his start?

Get out on the Chicago River and Lake Michigan while learninf about the history
of Chicago’s architecture with an architectural boat tour. Visit the [Chicago
