    At the south end of Chicago’s lakefront Grant Park, [museum campus][] is a
    three-in-one stop for the avid museum goer.  Explore natural history at the
    Field Museum, dive under the sea at Shedd Aquarium, or fly to the stars at the
    Adler Planetarium.

    If you’re lucky, you might see Kelly getting a veggie dog on her lunch break
    from the [Zooniverse][] offices at the Adler. If you do see her, don’t think
    that her condiment choices mean that it’s okay to have ketchup on your
    Chicago-style hot dog.

    K&R tip: even if you don’t want to learn about the universe, the peninsula that
    houses the planetarium has the best views of the Chicago skyline you can get
    without getting in a boat.

    As an outdoor zoological garden, the [Lincoln Park Zoo][lpzoo] is a great place to
    spend a warm spring day. Best of all, admission is free — see as much or as
    little as you like and come and go as you please.

    If you plan on going to the Zoo, note that the <a href="locations.html#hotels-
    daysinn" class="comingsoon">Days Inn Chicago</a> hotel is a short ride away in a
    cab or the #22 bus.

    The site of many dates throughout our relationship, the [Music Box][musicbox] is
    a beautifully restored movie theater [from 1929][mb-history]. It offers a variety
    of independent and foreign first-run releases, plus weekend matinee and midnight
    movie series of classic films.

    The Music Box publishes its [showing calendar][mb-comingsoon] seasonally, so
    the schedule for our wedding week should be available by late February.

    The [fourth-tallest building in Chicago][chicago-tall], the John Hancock
    Building has a couple of advantages as a tourist attraction for height
    enthusiasts vs. its taller counterparts such as the Sears Tower.

    * It’s set off from the loop (the main portion of downtown), so you can see the city without looking straight down on it.
    * It’s right on the Magnificent Mile portion of Michigan Ave.
    * It has a restaurant and bar on its top two floors.

    That’s right: instead of overpaying for an [observation platform ticket
    ][hancock-obs], you can take the elevator straight up to the [Signature Lounge
    ][sig-room] and overpay for a drink. It’s a more relaxed and sophisticated
    context in which to comment that all those people down on the ground look like
    ants.
