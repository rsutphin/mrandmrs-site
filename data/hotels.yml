    Located in the heart of Chicago’s Lincoln Park neighborhood, the Days Inn
    Chicago offers a great jumping off point for exploration of the city. It’s
    near the Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan and has easy access (via the
    Red Line) to the Magnificent Mile, downtown, and Museum Campus.

    As the crow flies, it’s the closest to the [wedding location](wedding.html)
    (though the others have more direct public transit access).

    The Days Inn Chicago offers a free continental breakfast. It charges $24/day
    for valet parking with in/out privileges.
